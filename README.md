
## Overview

[PureMVC](http://puremvc.org/) is a lightweight framework for creating applications based upon the classic  
Model-View-Controller design meta-pattern. 

This is the specific implementation for the Delphi language, 
based in a previous [C# port](http://trac.puremvc.org/PureMVC_CSharp) by Andy Adamczak
